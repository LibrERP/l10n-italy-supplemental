LibrERP
=======
For now, LibrERP is just an additional addons repository to the OCB repositories, focusing in adding functionality and maintaining it for the 6.1 version of OpenERP. It is not a fork, it works together with the OCB server, web and addons repositories.
The web_client module is thou based on enapps v1 client with an "eyecandy" graphical redesign. Feel free to check it.
